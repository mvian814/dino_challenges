for this dinochallenge youre going to sort the dinos into groups by name and height (imperial units)

all dinos that contain 'saur' are 'a real dino' other wise they are 'not a thunder lizard'

all dinos that are 15 feet tall are 'big dinos'

round all heights of 'big dinos' to the nearest integer (order greatest to least)

the velociraptor will be labeled the 'the smartest dino' will have its height rounded like the 'big dinos' and will not be in any other group
