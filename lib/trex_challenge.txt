for this dinochallenge, you will use information from the largest trex to make calculations for several trex from jurassic park franchise.

you will be given an input file, assign an alphanumeric tracking number, calculate, sort, and output the new data.

**all results in meters (m) to one
decimal place

THE LARGEST TREX
  largest trex(Sue):
  length: 12.3 meters (40 ft)
  hip height: 3.66 meters (12 ft)
  foot length: 83 centimeters (33 in)
  foot height: 71 centimeters (28 in)
  stride length: 3.7 (12 ft)
  running speed: 24 kph (15 mph)

THE CHALLENGE(DETAILS)
assign alphanumeric number tracking number
  jurassic park with begin with the letter "a"
  lost word will begin with the letter "b"
  jurassic park iii begin with the letter "c"
  jurassic world begin with the letter "d".

using sue's measurements, calculate the following(assume linear relationships):
  hip height
  stride length
  running speed

Use this information to calculate the foot length:
  leg length can be found by taking the footprint length times 5

Use this information to calculate the Froude number:
  Fr = v^2/gh, where v is the forward velocity(use running speed), g the acceleration due to gravity(9.8 m/s^2), and h the hip height.
  *if number Fr = 16 then say 'Fr of ostrich'


EXAMPLE OUTPUT (in order from fastest to slowest)
a06
running speed: 20.0 kph
hip height: 3.1 m
foot length: 0.8 m
froude number: 16.0 (*Fr of ostrich)

d11
running speed: 19.0 kph
hip height: 3.0 m
foot length: 0.7 m
froude number: 15.0
